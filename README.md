## Overview

The system uses a trained deep learning model (`prediction_plant.h5`) to classify plant diseases from input images. It provides predictions based on the trained data for various plant species and their diseases.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jaikumar2406/Plant-Disease-Detection-System-for-Sustainable-Agriculture.git
## Usage
Place your plant images in the specified input folder.
Run the prediction script to get the results:
bash
Copy code
python predict.py
The model will output the predicted disease and the probability of the disease.

## Contributing
